# Neuromorphix

**Work-in-Progress**

## Overview

The Neuromorphix package introduces methods for describing neuromorphic architectures, providing developers with powerful abstractions for formally defining designs specific to neuromorphic processor microarchitectures.

## Features

- **Leaky**: Example usage of Neuromorphix for designing a simple Leaky Integrate-and-Fire accelerator.
- **lif_acc**: A generator that specifies parameters for the simulated spiking neural network.
